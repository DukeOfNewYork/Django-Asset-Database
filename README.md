# Django-Asset-Database

You're going to need to make a media folder if you want to use the image upload/storing features. There are many tutorials for any high-performance HTTP server you chose to use.

This website is fairly basic but sorts assets based on building and location 
![Main Form Screen](/DemoImages/MainSite.png "Main Form Screen")
The list of buildings is automatically built off of the buildings created on the admin page. 

The all assets screen shows all assets stored, and an image if there is one and the default created one if none.

and export creates a csv of all assets organized by building then room.
